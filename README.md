Basic Calculator using Javascript 


I designed and developed a basic calculator utilizing the popular web development technologies of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The calculator boasts a comprehensive array of standard calculator functions, such as addition, multiplication, and division, as well as others. The user is able to perform arithmetic operations with ease and efficiency through the simple, intuitive interface of the calculator. Additionally, I added several features to augment the user experience, such as a visually appealing background that elevates the calculator's aesthetics and an assortment of other functionalities that make it more user-friendly. The resultant product is a robust and user-friendly calculator that makes performing calculations a breeze.
